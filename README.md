# Mexican_3D_Printer
MKB mod script to 'print' an area in minecraft singleplayer (Creative Mode, cheats enabled, Minecraft 1.12.1)

It's set by default to a 4-storey house. This can be edited changing the value of the string variable &house

To copy another building, run the auxiliary script. It will copy things that are North-East from you, in a 14x17x14 area, and save the string in a .txt file in your .minecraft/liteconfig/common/macros/logs folder. Copy all of its content and replace &house (in the main file) with it.
